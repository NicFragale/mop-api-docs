There are two major versions of the NetFoundry API core represented by distinct base URL paths in the API, and a simple `/vN/` in this documentation. Click a version to load the corresponding documentation.

[/core/v2](/v2/){: .btn .btn--info .btn--x-large} works with Ziti (>= v0.13). RapidAPI support is coming soon!
